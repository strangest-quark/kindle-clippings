You know your heart is dancing, you know you are surrounded by celestial music, you know fragrances that you have never known before.

Our hands are small and our sins are small. Our reach is small; how can we commit sins which God’s love cannot forgive? If God is love then he cannot be present on the last judgment day to sort out the saints and throw the remaining millions and millions of people into hell for eternity.”

But if it is possible, if you love a person and live the whole life with him or with her, a great intimacy will grow and love will have deeper and deeper revelations to make to you. It is not possible if you go on changing partners very often. It is as if you go on changing a tree from one place to another, then another; then it never grows roots anywhere. To grow roots, a tree needs to remain in one place. Then it goes deeper; then it becomes stronger.

I suggested that qualia and self are different. Yet you can’t solve the former without the latter. The notion of qualia without a self experiencing/introspecting on them is an oxymoron. In similar vein Freud had argued that we cannot equate the self with consciousness. Our mental life, he said, is governed by the unconscious, a roiling cauldron of memories, associations, reflexes, motives, and drives. Your ‘conscious life’ is an elaborate after-the-fact rationalization of things you really do for other reasons.

This is astonishing. It implies that only the information streaming through your visual cortex is associated with consciousness and linked to your sense of self. The other parallel pathway can go about its business performing the complex computations required for hand guidance (or even correctly guessing colour) without consciousness ever coming into the picture. Why? These two paths for visual information are made up of identical-looking neurons, after all, and they seem to be performing equally complex computations, yet only the new pathway casts the light of consciousness on visual information.

Such denial usually happens as a result of additional damage to the postulated ‘devil’s advocate’ in the right hemisphere’s frontoparietal regions, which allows the left hemisphere to go into an ‘open loop’, taking its denials to absurd limits.

The explanation I propose is to think of Cotard syndrome as an extreme and more general form of Capgras syndrome. People with Cotard syndrome often lose interest in viewing art and listening to music, presumably because such stimuli also fail to evoke emotions. This is what we might expect if all or most sensory pathways to the amygdala are totally severed (as opposed to Capgras syndrome, in which just the ‘face’ area in the fusiform gyrus is disconnected from the amygdala). Thus for a Cotard patient, the entire sensory world, not just mum and dad, would seem derealized—unreal, as in a dream. If you added to this cocktail a derangement of reciprocal connections between the mirror neurons and the frontal lobe system, you would lose your sense of self as well.

So here we have a situation where the motor cortex was continually sending out movement commands to the arm, which the parietal lobe continually saw as having absolutely zero muscular or sensory effect. The synapses that used to support the strong correlations between motor commands and the sensory feedback they should generate were shown to be liars. Every new, impotent motor signal reinforced this trend, so the synapses grew weaker and weaker and eventually became moribund. In other words, the paralysis was learned by the brain, stamped into the circuitry where the patient’s body image was constructed. Later, when the arm was amputated, the learned paralysis got carried over into the phantom so the phantom felt paralysed.

Like mirror neurons, each canonical neuron fires during the performance of a specific action such as reaching for a vertical twig or an apple. But the same neuron will also fire at the mere sight of a twig or an apple. In other words, it is as though the abstract property of graspability were being encoded as an intrinsic aspect of the object’s visual shape. The distinction between perception and action exists in our ordinary language, but it is one that the brain evidently doesn’t always respect.

First, what you see can’t just be the image on the retina because the retinal image can remain constant but your perception can change radically. If perception simply involves transmitting and displaying an image on an inner mental screen, how can this be true? Second, the converse is also true: The retinal image can change, yet your perception of the object remains stable. Third, despite appearances, perception takes time and happens in stages.

Thus any observed colour will excite the red, green, and blue receptors in different ratios, and higher brain mechanisms interpret each ratio as a different colour. Yellow light, for example, falls halfway in the spectrum between red and green, so it activates red and green receptors equally and the brain has learned, or evolved to interpret, this as the colour we call yellow.

What these back projections are doing is anybody’s guess, but my hunch is that at each stage in processing, whenever the brain achieves a partial solution to a perceptual ‘problem’—such as determining an object’s identity, location, or movement—this partial solution is immediately fed back to earlier stages.

In the late 1970s a woman in Zurich, whom I’ll call Ingrid, suffered a stroke that damaged the MT areas on both sides of her brain but left the rest of her brain intact. Ingrid’s vision was normal in most respects: She could read newspapers and recognize objects and people. But she had great difficulty seeing movement. When she looked at a moving car, it appeared like a long succession of static snapshots, as if seen under a strobe. She could read the number plate and tell you what colour it was, but there was no impression of motion. She was terrified of crossing the street because she didn’t know how fast the cars were approaching. When she poured water into a glass, the stream of water looked like a static icicle.

He pointed out that even though a specific number always produces the same colour for any given synaesthete, the number–colour associations are different for different synaesthetes. In other words, it’s not as though all synaesthetes see a 5 as red or a 6 as green. To Mary, 5 always looks blue, 6 is magenta, and 7 is chartreuse. To Susan, 5 is vermilion, 6 is light green, and 4 is yellow.

But number–line synaesthetes are different.

Remember, Spike’s cone receptors are deficient, but the problem is entirely in his eyes. His retinas are unable to send the full normal range of colour signals up to the brain, but in all likelihood his cortical colour-processing areas, such as V4 in the fusiform, are perfectly normal. At the same time, he is a number–colour synaesthete.

Fortunately, we found there was an easy way to do this using electroencephalography (EEG), which uses a grid of electrodes placed on the scalp to pick up brainwaves. Long before CT scans and MRIs, EEG was the very first brain-imaging technology invented by humans. It was pioneered in the early twentieth century, and has been in clinical use since the 1940s.

As in normal children, Justin exhibited a robust mu wave while he sat around idly, and the mu wave was suppressed whenever we asked him to make simple voluntary movements. But remarkably, when he watched someone else perform the action, the suppression did not occur as it ought to. This observation provided a striking vindication of our hypothesis. We concluded that the child’s motor-command system was intact—he could, after all, open doors, eat potato chips, draw pictures, climb stairs, and so on—but his mirror-neuron system was deficient.

TMS is, in one sense, the opposite of EEG: Rather than passively eavesdropping on the electrical signals emanating from the brain, TMS creates electrical currents in the brain using a powerful magnet held over the scalp. Thus with TMS you can induce neural activity artificially in any brain region that happens to be near the scalp. (Unfortunately, many brain regions are tucked away in the brain’s deep folds, but plenty of other regions, including the motor cortex, are conveniently located directly beneath the skull where TMS can ‘zap’ them easily.)

We showed that if you bite into a pencil (as if it were a bridle bit) to stretch your mouth into a wide, fake smile, you will have difficulty detecting another person’s smile (but not a frown). This is because biting the pencil activates many of the same muscles as a smile, and this floods your brain’s mirror-neuron system, creating a confusion between action and perception.

There are two ways such a system could be set up. First, as soon as the word is heard, a memory trace of the phonemes (speech sounds) is set up in the auditory cortex. The baby then tries various random utterances and, using error feedback from the memory trace, progressively refines the output to match memory. (We all do this when we internally hum a recently heard tune and then sing it out loud, progressively refining the output to match the internal humming.)

why autistic individuals find social interaction and strong self-identification so difficult, and why so many autistic children have a hard time correctly using the pronouns ‘I’ and ‘you’ in conversation: They may lack a mature-enough mental self-representation to understand the distinction. This hypothesis would predict that even otherwise high-functioning autistics who can talk normally (highly verbal autistics are said to have Asperger’s syndrome, a subtype among autistic spectrum disorders) would have difficulty with such conceptual distinctions between words such as ‘self-esteem’, ‘pity’, ‘mercy’, ‘forgiveness’, and ‘embarrassment’, not to mention ‘self-pity’, which would make little sense without a full-fledged sense of self.

For example, Stanford University professor Sean Mackey put chronic pain patients in a brain-imaging scanner and showed them a computer-animated image of a flame. The size of the flame at any given moment was a representation of the neural activity in each patient’s anterior cingulate (a cortical region involved in pain perception), and was thus proportional to the subjective amount of pain he or she was in. By concentrating on the flame, most of the patients were able to gain some control over its size and to keep it small, and ipso facto to reduce the amount of pain they were experiencing.

the same token, one could monitor mu waves on an autistic child’s scalp and display them on a screen in front of her, perhaps in the guise of a simple thought-controlled video game, to see if she can somehow learn to suppress them. Assuming her mirror-neuron function is weak or dormant rather than absent, this kind of exercise might boost her ability to see through to the intentionality of others, and bring her a step closer to joining the social world that swirls invisibly around her.

we recently encountered an autistic child whose brain MRI showed a substantial reduction in the size of the olfactory bulb, which receives smell signals from the nose. Given that smell is a major factor in the regulation of social behaviour in most mammals, we wondered: Is it conceivable that olfactory-bulb malfunction plays a major role in the genesis of autism? Reduced olfactory-bulb activity would diminish oxytocin and prolactin, which in turn might reduce empathy and compassion. Needless to say, this is all pure speculation on my part, but in science, fancy is often the mother of fact—at least often enough that premature censorship of speculation is never a good idea.

Indeed, our research team has found that such self-stimulation not only has a calming effect but leads to a measurable reduction in GSR. This suggests a possible symptomatic therapy for autism: One could have a portable device for monitoring GSR that then feeds back to a body stimulation device which the child wears under his clothing.
